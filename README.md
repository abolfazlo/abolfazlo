# Hi there! 👋 I'm Abolfazl

I'm a PhD student in Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University, specializing in **Robotics, Control Systems**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. My research focuses on integrating **Unmanned Aerial Manipulators (UAMs)** by combining classic control theories and modern AI-driven approaches.

### 🔬 Research Highlights
- **Dynamic Modeling & Control**: Developed robust dynamic models for aerial manipulators using deep learning architectures like FNN, TCN, and RNN. 
- **Control Design**: Designed adaptive **Tube-based MPC**, and **Reinforcement Learning-based** controllers for UAV and manipulator systems.
- **System Integration**: Integrated UAVs with robotic arms in simulation (ROS1/ROS2, Gazebo, PX4) and real-world platforms.
  
### 💻 Technical Expertise
- **Programming**: Python, C++, MATLAB
- **Robotics Frameworks**: ROS1, ROS2, Gazebo, PX4
- **AI & ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, d3rlpy
- **Data Science & Optimization**: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- **Electronics & Embedded Systems**: Microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi

### 🚀 Projects & Interests
- Deep learning approaches such as **Reinforcement Learning** for robotics control
- Research in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **AI-based Automation**
- Robotics software development and dynamic control and system identification.

### 📚 Teaching & Mentorship
- Experienced teaching assistant and mentor for various engineering courses.
- Developer of hands-on coding and robotics projects for students.
